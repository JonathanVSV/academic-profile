This blog entry will show how to use STAC using R. This example was based on the original [STAC tutorial](https://stacspec.org/en/tutorials/1-download-data-using-r/).

First check data providers in the following link [Datasets](https://stacspec.org/en/about/datasets/).

Then load necessary packages.

```r
library(sf)
library(rstac)
library(stars)
library(purrr)
```

In this example we will use Sentinel-2 Collection 1 Level 2A from AWS. Other popular providers are the Microsoft Planetary Computer on https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1. Remember to set the url up to "v1", i.e., not including the collectino _per se_.

Define data provider.

```r
stac_source <- rstac::stac(
  "https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1"
)
```

Then, let's see which collections are available in the endpoint.

```r
col_quer <- stac_source |>
  rstac::collections()
```

Before running `get_request` the request is only represented as a future query. Let's do the request.

```r
available_collections <- rstac::get_request(col_quer)
available_collections
```

Create a roi or read it from a gpkg file. Need to run at the en `st_bbox` to be used in the query. Here I created an example roi.

```r
roi <- st_as_sf(tibble::tibble(lat = c(-101.33706520389003,-101.33706520389003,-100.79873512576503, -100.79873512576503, -101.33706520389003),
                        lon = c(19.589466998816956, 20.0674578405529, 20.0674578405529,19.589466998816956, 19.589466998816956)),
         coords = c("lat", "lon"),
         crs = 4326) |>
  st_cast("MULTIPOINT", group_or_split = TRUE) |>
  st_union() |>
  st_cast("POLYGON") 

roibbox <- roi |>
  st_bbox()
```

From the available collections copy and paste the one you are interested in, set the datetime, roi and limit of images.

```r
executed_stac_query <- rstac::stac_search(
  q = stac_source,
  collections = "sentinel-2-c1-l2a",
  bbox = roi,
  datetime = "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z/2021-07-31T23:59:59Z"
) |>
rstac::get_request()
```

See objects included in query. Check names of bands of interest so they can be used in the download step.

```r
signed_stac_query <- rstac::items_sign(
  executed_stac_query,
  rstac::sign_planetary_computer()
)
signed_stac_query
```

Download images

```r
folder <- "myfolder"

rstac::assets_download(signed_stac_query, 
                       c("nir", "red"), 
                       output_dir = folder)
```

Let's check the files. We'll need a loop to stack the two bands for a single date and then create a spatiotemporal object, setting the date as the time dimension. This checking can be done using `terra` or `stars` packages. Here we used `stars`.

Finally, let's plot the first band in the two available dates.

```r
files <- list.files(folder, "B08|B04", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)

# Read only first two images (two dates)
imgs <- map(c(1,3), function(i){
  read_stars(files[c(i, (i+1))], proxy = TRUE)
})

# Stack along the time dimension
imgs2 <- do.call(c, c(imgs, along = "time"))

# See result
plot(imgs2[1,,,1:2])
```
