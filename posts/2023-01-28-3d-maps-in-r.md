# 3D maps in R

The purpose of this post is to show how make a 3D map using `rayshader`. The idea is to use a DEM obtained from the SRTM mission (worldwide cover) or an available DEM from other National Institutions, such as Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography to obtain a 3D relief of the area of interest; and an RGB composite to overlay it on the relief. The cloudless RGB mosaic I am using in this post was obtained from Landsat-8 images and was produced using Google Earth Engine. Finally, a shapefile with the locations of two urban settlements in the area is loaded to show their location.

First load the libraries we are going to use.

```r
library(rayshader)
library(raster)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
```

Then, read the images.

```r
dem <- raster("dem_more.tif")
locs <- st_read("Morelia.shp")
rgb <- stack("rgb.tif")
```

Then, clip the rgb image values to the lower and upper 3 % quantiles so the image can be better appreciated.

```r
quants <- quantile(as.vector(values(rgb)), c(0.03, 0.97))

# Clip values to lower and upper 3 %
rgb[rgb < quants[1]] <- quants[1]
rgb[rgb > quants[2]] <- quants[2]
rgb <- ((rgb - quants[1])* 1/ quants[2]) + 0
```

Next, let's transform the rgb into an array and the dem into matrix, so they can be rendered in 3D.

```r
rgb_array = as.array(rgb)
dem_mat <-  raster_to_matrix(dem)
```

Extract the coordinates of the two human settlements used as reference (as numbers) and drop the geometry. 

```r
locs <- locs |>
  mutate(x = st_coordinates(locs)[,1],
         y = st_coordinates(locs)[,2]) |>
  st_drop_geometry()
```

Afterward, do the 3d rendering with the rgb and dem layers and set additional parameters for the visualization. Subsequently, add the labels of the two localities.

```r
rgb_array |>
plot_3d(dem_mat, 
        zscale = 12, 
        fov = 0, 
        theta = 20, 
        zoom = 0.65, 
        # azimut
        phi = 45, 
        windowsize = c(1000, 800)) 
  render_label(dem_mat,
               long = locs$x[1],
               lat = locs$y[1],
               # altitude = 120000,
               zscale = 19,
               extent = raster::extent(dem),
               text = locs$Nombre[1],
               linecolor = "white",
               textcolor = "white")
  render_label(dem_mat,
               long = locs$x[2],
               lat = locs$y[2],
               # altitude = 120000,
               zscale = 14,
               extent = raster::extent(dem),
               text = locs$Nombre[2],
               linecolor = "white",
               textcolor = "white")
```

Finally, save a snapshot of the 3d model.

```r
render_snapshot(filename = "Morelia3D.png",
                gravity = "North")
```

The result:

![3D map of Patzcuaro and Morelia surroundings in Michoacán, Mexico.](/assets/images/Morelia3D.png)


If you are familiar with the surrounding of Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico, you will immediatly recognize Patzcuaro and Cuitzeo lakes, as well as some hills, such as the Quinceo.
